# Fake Store API

Welcome to the **Fake Store API** documentation.  
This documentation is automatically generated from NestJS controllers and DTOs using Swagger and Widdershins, and published via GitBook.

The API provides functionality for:

- User authentication (`Auth`)
- User (`User`)
- Products (`Products`)
- Categories (`Categories`)
- Cart (`Cart`)

> Use the sidebar to navigate to the desired API section.  
> Each section corresponds to an `@ApiTags` tag in the NestJS controllers.

## How to Use the Documentation

1. Select the desired section from the sidebar.
2. View the list of endpoints and their descriptions.
3. For each endpoint, examples of requests and responses are available in **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.
4. All fields and object structures are documented through DTOs and `@ApiProperty` decorators.

## Project Purpose

The Fake Store API is designed for testing and learning:

- Can be used for frontend development without a custom backend
- A great base for learning NestJS, Swagger, TypeORM, and GitBook integration
